## 🎯 What is CityConnect?

CityConnect is a centralized MERN stack web application designed to bridge the gap between urban residents and municipal authorities. It replaces fragmented, manual paperwork with a transparent digital dashboard for managing city-wide services. 
From reporting broken roads to organizing local events or finding life-saving blood donors, CityConnect integrates critical civic functions into one seamless interface.

```
Citizen reports issue → Gov Agency tracks & resolves → Citizen receives real-time update
```
